# 👋 Hi, I'm Christopher!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently working as an iOS Engineer Intern at MoodMe. My passion for Swift and building innovative apps has led me to publish three apps, **iMirror: Reflect & Grow**, **CentSage**, and **Globe: World History** on the App Store. 📱

👨‍💻 I'm continuing to sharpen my skills through a series of smaller projects utilizing UIKit and SwiftUI and staying active in the iOS community.
